## Current State

- secrets are stored in a 1Password vault in my account named `k8s`
- there is a 1Password connect server defined named `argocd-dev`
- this connect server provides:
  - `1password-credentials.json` - used to authenticate from the connect server to 1Password
  - access token - used for clients to authenticate to the connect server
- the connect server is deployed via the `1password/connect` helm chart

## Future State

- secrets generated by [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/)
- secrets retrieved from external provider depending on environment(?):
  - `local` - 1Password
  - `xcel-on-prem` - AWS Secrets Manager
